# Roadmap

OpinCode direction, what's shipped, what's coming, and what's deliberately out of scope.

This file is updated as direction evolves. For day-to-day work, see [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ajmalleonard/opincode-ai/issues) and the Projects board.

## What OpinCode is

OpinCode is a fast, lightweight, AI-native terminal (ADE - agentic development environment). It pairs a native PTY backend with a modern UI: multi-tab terminals, an integrated code editor, a file explorer, source control, and a first-class AI agent system that works with your own API keys or fully local models. No telemetry. Keys stored in the OS keychain.

The product is opinionated: terminal-first, AI as a primitive (not a sidebar), lightweight always, cross-platform without compromise.

## What OpinCode is not

- Not a full IDE replacement. Heavy IDE features that overlap with VS Code / Cursor / Zed are out of scope.
- Not a browser. Web preview exists for local dev servers and lightweight doc viewing only.
- Not a general workspace. Tools and formats that pull the product away from the terminal-first surface are out of scope.
- Not a one-size-fits-all CLI replacement. The goal is "best AI-native terminal", not "shell with extras".

## Themes

The themes below frame every scope decision.

1. **AI as a native primitive.** Agents, tools, autocomplete, voice - first-class, not a panel bolted onto a regular terminal.
2. **Lightweight always.** 7-8 MB binary. Every dependency justified. Per-tab memory budget enforced.
3. **Terminal-first.** xterm.js correctness, PTY fidelity, TUI app compatibility are non-negotiable.
4. **Cross-platform parity.** macOS, Linux, Windows, WSL. No platform-specific exclusives.
5. **Security by default.** Path guards, SSRF protection, OSC trust, IPC sandboxing. Defaults safe out of the box.

## Planned

### Coming next

- [ ]  SSH support (PTY auth and known_hosts first; SFTP and port forwarding later)
- [ ]  Themes and customizations (terminal themes, UI accents, keybindings, layout)
- [ ]  AI autocomplete improvements in editor (project-aware context, lower latency)
- [ ]  Drag and drop in terminal (files as quoted paths, AI panel as context)
- [ ]  AI-driven smart diagnostics (detecting non-zero exit codes in the terminal with one-click auto-fix proposals)
- [ ]  Interactive inline command widgets (rendering structured command outputs like JSON, CSV, and markdown tables as rich UI cards)
- [ ]  Visual agent execution timeline (step-by-step trace showing file edits, commands run, and AI planning steps)
- [ ]  AI agent meta-orchestration (OpinCode agent spawning and managing external coding agents like Claude Code / OpenCode)
- [ ]  Multi-agent peer collaboration (pair programming interfaces with external terminal-based agents like Claude Code)
- [ ]  More slash commands and skills
- [ ]  Preview surface expansion (better image / Markdown handling)
- [ ]  Test coverage expansion (PTY edge cases, security functions, AI tool guards)

### Longer horizon

- [ ]  Local semantic workspace indexing (lightweight vector-less context generation for fast and precise AI workspace grounding)
- [ ]  Release automation (CHANGELOG, version bump, tag flow)
- [ ]  Bundle optimization (lazy-load language packs, individual UI primitive imports, tree-shake)
- [ ]  Selective TS → Rust migration where the profiler shows measurable wins
- [ ]  AI tools / skills as installable bundles
- [ ]  Live filesystem updates in explorer and editor

## Wanted contributions

Strategic areas where help is welcome. Pick something and propose an approach in Discord or via an issue first.

- **Test coverage.** PTY edge cases across platforms, security functions, AI tool guards.
- **Bundle optimization.** Profile and propose specific dependency replacements or tree-shake fixes.
- **Platform-specific bugs.** Rendering issues on niche distros, shell quirks, WSL edge cases.
- **Documentation and translations.** Improvements, screenshots, examples, non-English README sections.
- **Themes.** Terminal and editor themes, UI accent palettes that fit the lightweight aesthetic.
- **Provider integrations.** Only providers that add unique value beyond existing coverage. Justify the case before implementing.

See `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` labels on GitHub Issues for concrete tasks.

## Out of scope

Categories that will not be built into OpinCode. Individual feature requests in these categories will be closed.

- **Heavy IDE features.** Full language-server integration, integrated debuggers, refactoring engines, project-wide search at IDE scale. Use a real editor for those.
- **Notebook and document workspaces.** Anything that turns OpinCode into a document host rather than a terminal.
- **Package manager and toolchain UIs.** Use `npm`, `pip`, `cargo` and friends in the terminal directly.
- **Full web browser features.** Preview pane stays scoped to local dev servers and lightweight doc viewing. No navigation history, no bookmarks, no dev tools.
- **Telemetry, analytics, accounts.** OpinCode stays BYOK and offline-respectful.
- **Extension marketplaces at IDE scale.** Narrowly-scoped AI tool / skill bundles may happen eventually. Arbitrary UI or behavior extensions will not.
- **Third-party subscription session bridges.** Forwarding cloud subscription auth (provider-managed login sessions) through OpinCode is not technically feasible for third-party clients.

## Decision authority

Direction and scope decisions are made by [@ajmalleonard](https://github.com/ajmalleonard). Trusted reviewers (informal, no fixed roles yet) provide input on security, performance, and platform-specific areas.

If a PR is closed and you disagree, raise it in Discord. Happy to discuss, not happy to be ambushed in a PR comment thread.

This will likely formalize over time as the project grows.
